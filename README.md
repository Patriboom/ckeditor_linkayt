In addition, linkayt recognize the Ctrl-Enter command as a submit command.

Your comments are welcome.
Help for this little missing step is also welcome:
    I would like to remove the orginal text and replace it by the link.
    Now it gives this: « My text is here and the link comes here like http://ckedior.com ( ckeditor.com (as link) ) »
    Should be:  « My text is here and the link comes here like ckeditor.com (as link) »
